# Process Scheduling Playground: Exploring Scheduling Algorithms in C
## Short description :

Explore process scheduling in operating systems with C. This repository showcases scheduling algorithms (such as FIFO, SRT..). Run the code, observe results, and deepen your understanding of process management. Perfect for OS enthusiasts and developers. Happy coding!



### Topic Introduction :

The present document outlines the detailed specifications for the development project of a multitasking scheduling algorithm simulation system. The primary goal of this project is to design and implement a simulation environment capable of generating random tasks and applying various multitasking scheduling algorithms to assess their performance on a Linux operating system. The programming language used is C.



### Goals :

The project aims to provide a flexible and extensible simulation tool for studying and comparing the performance of multitasking scheduling algorithms. The main objectives include:


- Generating random tasks with various characteristics (execution time, priorities, arrival time).
- Implementing multiple multitasking scheduling algorithms.
- Allowing the configuration of simulation parameters, including the number of tasks, arrival intervals, scheduling parameters, etc.
- Collecting data on task execution and algorithm performance metrics.
- Visualizing simulation results through graphs and statistics.
